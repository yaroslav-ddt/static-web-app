This is an example of deploying Azure Static Web Application using terraform and GitHub actions.
This project contains web application source files in the folder src and function application code in the folder api.
For another framework, f.e. React, the function application folder must be named build and 
the file ./terraform/azure-static-web-app.tpl have to be adjusted accordenly.

Prerequisites:
 - Azure tenant and subscription
 - Service principal with contribution rights on the subscription
 - Storage account where the terraform state will be saved
 - GitHub token

The following secrets have to be added to the GitHub repository secrets:
ARM_CLIENT_ID - service principal id
ARM_CLIENT_SECRET - service principal secret
ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
ARM_TENANT_ID
REPO_TOKEN - github token
TERRAFORM_SA_ACCOUNT - storage account name
TERRAFORM_SA_CONTAINER - container name
TERRAFORM_SA_SAS - SAS created for the container

After successful deployment of the terraform workflow, the azure-static-web-app workflow starts automatically. 
At this moment the configuration of app settings cannot be done with terraform and the command "az staticwebapp appsettings set" doesn't work correctly, and therefore the connection of application insights to static web app should be done manually.
